# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15:  a missing `return` statement in a page component.  Next.js 15's stricter handling of page components can lead to unexpected runtime errors if a component does not explicitly return JSX.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file lacks a `return` statement, causing Next.js to throw an error during rendering. This is a subtle error that can be easily overlooked.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all page components explicitly return JSX.  The corrected `pages/aboutSolution.js` provides the fix.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd missing-return-nextjs`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

You can then observe the error with the original `about.js` and the corrected behavior with `aboutSolution.js`
